# Animal Kingdom Simulation

This project is a Java-based critter simulation designed for the Software Development course. The simulation demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts through the interaction of various critters with unique behaviors.

## Features
- **Bear**: Alternates between `/` and `\` and behaves differently if polar or non-polar.
- **Tiger**: Randomly changes color every three moves.
- **WhiteTiger**: Starts as `tgr` and becomes `TGR` after infecting another critter.
- **Giant**: Cycles through phrases "fee", "fie", "foe", "fum" every six moves.
- **NinjaCat**: Customizable critter with unique behavior.

## How to Run
1. **Requirements**:
   - Java Development Kit (JDK 17 or later) installed.
   - A code editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code).

2. **Steps**:
   - Clone this repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/syifa1612/AnimalKingdomFinalProject.git
     ```
   - Navigate to the project folder:
     ```bash
     cd AnimalKingdomFinalProject
     ```
   - Compile the Java files:
     ```bash
     javac src/*.java
     ```
   - Run the simulation:
     ```bash
     java -cp src CritterMain
     ```

3. **Controls**:
   - **Start**: Begin the simulation.
   - **Stop**: Pause the simulation.
   - **Step**: Move the simulation forward one step.
   - **Debug**: Observe critter actions in detail.
